# OPP => object oriented programming
## opps means organazing the program structure
### it is programming paradignm based on object, which are data structures that contains data in the form of feilds , oftern known as attributes , and code in the form oof proceducres, often known as methods

#    NEED FOR OPP APPRAOCH
## better suited for team development
## creating utilizable software component
## reusability of code
## easier gui programming
## easier software maintenance
## scalable
## adaptable
## extensible


### structure programming techniques
## top-down , bottom-up 
## it's all about thinking and logic and actions 

## platform broken down into no. of units. and this units call objects.

#         OBJECTS
## entity that has state , behaivior known as objects
## real world example : a book . a book got a name(state) , author(behaviour) etc .
## it will be physical or logical
## instance of class 
## class is template from which object is created so object is instance of class


##   CHARACTERISTICS OF OBJECT

### STATE => set of data consist of feilds (attribute should be static and dynamic)

### BEHAVIOR => represent the functionality
### IDENTITY => identity (object name)
### RESPONSIBILITY

# OBJECT MODEL
## ABSTRACTION
## ENCAPSULATION
## INHERITANCE
## POLYMORPHISM
